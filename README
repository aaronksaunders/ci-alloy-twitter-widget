Sample Appcelerator Alloy Application with a sample widget. The widget was based on the same approach used for the 
com.appcelerator.searchForBooks widget but this one integrates twitter and I have added some comments in the code
which made the whole process clearly for me.

Hope someone finds this helpful.

Here is the Appcelerator documentation on widgets
